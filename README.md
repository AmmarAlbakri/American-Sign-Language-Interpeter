# American-Sign-Language-Interpeter
A program for deaf individuals that interprets sign language to written text using deep learning.

# prerequisites
OpenCV2
Numpy
Keras
Tensorflow
PYNPUT

# The Model
The model has been trained on Google Colab using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and has reached an accuracy of 95% on test data

To test the model run "test model.py"

To obtain the the numpy classes for training run "preprocessing data.py"

# Using the Model to Predict 
Run "opencv_test.py" to run the program, sign different letters of the alphabet on a white background preferably.
To enter a space press space on the keyboard, to delete a letter press backspace and press q to exit.
